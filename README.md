# BF3 Viewmodel + ADS FoV Changer

A Cheat Engine Table that simply lets you tweak the Viewmodel/Ads Fov value for vanilla BF3. Works in both multiplayer and singleplayer modes. No risk of a ban while using this in MP servers, as it only modifies your Viewmodel appearance and Ads fov. As time goes on, I plan to keep adding more features to this table.

# How to use

1. Download Cheat engine from https://www.cheatengine.org/ and make sure to decline all the adware while installing the program.

2. Download
