# Battlefield 3: Redux

BF3: Redux is a Cheat Engine table made for vanilla BF3 which adds quality of life changes to make the game feel more modernized. It works in both multiplayer and singleplayer. Safe to use on PunkBuster servers, Cheat Engine doesn't get detected. As time goes on, I plan to keep adding more features to the table.
