# Battlefield 3: Redux

BF3: Redux is a Cheat Engine Table made for vanilla BF3 which adds quality of life features such as: configurable ADS FoV, ADS Sensitivity, Blue Filter Removal, Cleaner HUD and more! It works in both multiplayer and (kind of) singleplayer. Safe to play on PunkBuster servers, have been testing the mod for 200+ hours. As time goes on, I plan to keep adding more features to the table.
