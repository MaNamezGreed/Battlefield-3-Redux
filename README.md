# BF3 Viewmodel + ADS FoV Changer

A Cheat Engine Table that simply lets you tweak the Viewmodel/Ads Fov value for vanilla BF3. Works in both multiplayer and singleplayer modes. No risk of a ban while using this in MP servers, as it only modifies your Viewmodel appearance and Ads fov. As time goes on, I plan to keep adding more features to the table.

# Usage

I already have a tutorial video on how to setup everything (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzPCmBbABk8&t=2s) but If you don't wanna watch it, here's an explanation in text form

1. Make sure you have Cheat engine installed if not, download it from https://www.cheatengine.org/.

2. Open the Cheat table you downloaded from my github, click on 'Edit' > 'Settings' then find the 'Automatically attach to process named' textbox and type in bf3.exe. Check the 'Even auto attach when another process' box and press Ok

3. Join a random server, once you load in and deploy press F8 to activate the mod (Both 'Viewmodel FOV Script' and 'Viewmodel FOV Value' need to be Active in order to work properly, you may press F8 again or tick the boxes manually if only one of them is activated)

4. To change the value of an address, hover your mouse on the value section then double click and type in your desired value.

5. If you want to have 0 zoom in when you ADS (similiar to how it is on BF4/BF5) then you wanna copy the value of 'Regular FOV' address and paste it to 'ADS FOV'. 

6. Once you are done tinkering with the settings and want to save them everytime you activate the mod, then what you wanna do is right click on the modified address > Set/Change hotkeys and here type in your preffered value in 'Set your value to' hotkey section.
